# Communication Processes and Tools

(Section 4 of the chapter "you have a team of deveopers now, how to cope with the new challenges?")

## Braindump - section to be removed upon completion :)

There are many different options, here are team-level concerns to consider when picking
* Flexibility -- Artifacts to externalize cognition; sketches whiteboards etc - over-engineering or over-generalizing a communication solution inhibits its flexibility
* Ubiquity -- for something to be an effective communitation tool it has to be top-of-mind for everyone who is working. If there is a person who refuses, perhaps the expectations for on-boarding (and un-learning) are unreasonably strict. Things like a google doc whiteboard that can be projected during regular meetings are great.
* Maintenance -- The more effort it is to set up, the more effort it is to maintain. Work to minimize maintenance effort, and build maintenance into on-boarding and regular meeting.
* Can you show it off? Turns out, it is very rewarding (not to mention motivating) if the artifacts you work hard on -like documentation - are recognized and praised. The form factor, in this case, matters. Being able to pull up a page that demonstrate the pproductivity of the group is nice in a meeting - especially sicne meetings are often focused on problems and blockers and programming wokr, by its definition, is only visible in times of struggle.

Different communication artifacts and patterns:
* Github, issue tracking, etc - LINK to other chapter
* "Whiteboard" + links, free-form vs diagramming vs mindmapping
* Slack
* Project management - Trello / etc
* Read the docs
* iPyNB/Jupyter - figures etc are a form of communication
* Email - versatile and robust, buthard to persist effectively. Slack tries to address this challenge. Github through a lot of emails, sort of addresses some related challenges.
