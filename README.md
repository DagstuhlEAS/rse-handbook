## What is this handbook?

This handbook is for when **something is different.** So you know the basics of programming! This handbook is for RSE, PI, grad students who write research software.

What size project?
* Just you - see chapter X
* You and your PI - these
* You and your group - more
* 5-Person team - more

Project stage: 
* joining project
* starting project
* fixing project

A typology of software teams/projects as an index:
* If you are a beginner, do this stuff
* If you are a PI, read this stuff
* If you areâ€¦..etc
* Different kinds of software that suggest different levels of formalization

## Contribute!

* **Outline for each of the technical chapters:** "Here is what it is," followed by "Here is why it matters"
* Every chapter is in a section organized by an audience with a need.  Consider this audience and need during writing.
* Default choice if you don't care and just want to do something
Other choices with positives/negatives and questions you should ask to make a decision
* No tutorials! Find existing materials and link to them. This is a more meta reference for navigating those existing resources.
* Create an issue for working on your chapter and link it from the TOC; also link from the TOC to the work-in-progress .md file for your chapter
* **Copyright your writing!** Write "copyright your_name year" at the top of your files, please!
