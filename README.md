Outline for each of the technical chapters
* Here is what it is
* Here is why it matters
* Default choice if you don't care and just want to do something
* Other choices with positives/negatives and questions you should ask to make a decision

Guiding principles of the meta-handbook:
* Each chapter corresponds to a major topic, and offers a "default" option, followed by an explicit permission to stop reading if satisfied with the default. After that 
* Introductory guide is organized by type, stage, and size of project serving as a way to access a variety of reference materials
* No tutorials! Links to tutorials. (Except for the getting started!) These are about initial recommendations and offering questions for further discussion along with relevant trade-offs to consider.
* Sort of software carpentry for people writing code that other people will use.
