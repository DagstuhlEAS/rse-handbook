# Research Software Engineering Handbook

## What is this handbook?

This handbook is for when **something is different.** So you know the basics of programming! This handbook is for RSE, PI, grad students who write RS. 

What size project?
* Just you - see chapter X
* You and your PI - these
* You and your group - more
* 5-Person team - more

Project stage: 
* joining project
* starting project
* fixing project

A typology of software teams/projects as an index:
* If you are a beginner, do this stuff
* If you are a PI, read this stuff
* If you areâ€¦..etc
* Different kinds of software that suggest different levels of formalization

## Contribute!

**Outline for each of the technical chapters**
* Here is what it is
* Here is why it matters
* Default choice if you don't care and just want to do something
* Other choices with positives/negatives and questions you should ask to make a decision
* **Copyright your section!**

Guiding principles of the meta-handbook:
* Each chapter corresponds to a major topic, and offers a "default" option, followed by an explicit permission to stop reading if satisfied with the default. After that 
* Introductory guide is organized by type, stage, and size of project serving as a way to access a variety of reference materials
* No tutorials! Links to tutorials. (Except for the getting started!) These are about initial recommendations and offering questions for further discussion along with relevant trade-offs to consider.
* Sort of software carpentry for people writing code that other people will use.
